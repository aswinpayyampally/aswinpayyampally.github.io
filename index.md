## About Me ü´°

Aswin Payyampally is a enthusiastic **Research Fellow** in the Computer Science and Engineering discipline at [**Kerala University of Digital Sciences, Innovation and Technology (Digital University Kerala)**](https://duk.ac.in/), His area of interest includes **Internet of Things, Intrusion Detection, AI/ML, NLP**. I work on creating robust defenses against **IoT Attacks.**. Currently, Working on Security issues in IoT networks and immersive technologies, with a particular emphasis on Advancements in Intrusion Deection systems and lightweight mechanisms. Under the supervision of [Dr. Sabu M Thampi](http://www.sabumthampi.in/), he is exploring this cutting-edge field and the related security issues in IoT Networks and other related domains to come up with novel innovative contributions in the field.

He has completed his M.Tech. degree in Computer Science and Technology from the Central University of Punjab. [**Dr. Satwinder SIngh**](https://cup.edu.in/Dr_Satwinder_Singh.php) supervised him in his thesis entitled "A Systematic approach for Speech to Text Translation and Summarization". They explored various domains such as Natuaral Language processing, Machine Learning and Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence, etc. Earlier, he worked with Dr. Bindu P V through his B.Tech. graduation period in Computer Science and Engineering from Government College of Engineering Kannur,  Kannur University. They developed "Eye Controlled Virtual Keyboard using Deep Learning" as a major project and "Malayalam Handwritten Character Recognition" as a minor project. Aswin‚Äôs research interests encompass the Internet of Things (IoT), Cybersecurity, Intrusion Detection, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Natural Language Processing (NLP). His academic journey reflects a commitment to advancing knowledge in these dynamic fields.
